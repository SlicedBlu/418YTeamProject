This is the root directory of the backend server. 

Note: node_modules is no longer tracked in github. In order to load/update necesary dependencies perform "npm install" here which will load the files as per package.json. npm will automatically track the necesasry files there. AVOID EDITING PACKAGE.JSON MANUALLY.

Start server with:
nodemon servery
